        HyperMan
        <br />
        I am current working as part of the University of Manchester Hyperloop 
        team, working on the software engineering team. I am working on an 
        embedded control system for the pod written in C++ with a test-driven
        approach.

        NetSharp - <a href="https://github.com/mblenczewski/NetSharp">GitHub</a>
        <br />
        NetSharp is a (relatively) low-level networking library written in C#. 
        I am writing it using the Event-driven Asynchronous Pattern (EAP) to 
        get as high a bandwidth as possible.

        clfs-bootstrap - <a href="https://github.com/mblenczewski/clfs-bootstrap">GitHub</a>
        <br />
        This is my custom Linux "distribution". I wrote it following the "Cross 
        Linux From Scratch" guide (found <a href="https://trac.clfs.org">here</a>),
        but have since refactored the build script and updated the packages used.

        StarSim - <a href="https://github.com/mblenczewski/StarSim">GitHub</a>
        <br />
        StarSim was my A-Level computer science coursework, and is a 3D N-Body 
        simulator using the Barnes-Hutt algorithm. It also features a backing 
        database so that created systems can be exported, or imported to simulate.
