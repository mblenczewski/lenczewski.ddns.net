        Hi, i'm Mikołaj. I enjoy programming, physics, swimming, karate, and 
        playing video games. I am somewhat active on my GitHub profile, a link 
        to which can be found in the footer below. I find lower-level 
        programming — albeit challenging — hugely satisfying and fun. 
        Especially when it works!

        I am barely active on social media, but a link to my Twitter can be 
        found below. A link to a Discord server for this website can also be 
        found in the footer, and i will probably be easier to reach there than 
        on any other media. Feel free to shoot me a message to chat about 
        anything. I'm open to commissions, and can program confidently in C#, 
        C++, and C.
